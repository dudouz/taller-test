# Taller Test

Before anything, thanks for your time and opportunity, please let me know when you can access this repo and clone the code so I can make it private, I'll leave it public until you give me your OK.

## Considerations

Since I created using the `@latest` flag, please use --legacy-peer-deps when running `npm install`

## Application details

- Quickly bootstraped with React + Next + Tailwind
- Used NextJS API to create the dummy api endpoint
- Used `shadcn-ui` to quickly create primitive components and focus on the feature itself

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install everything server:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the app - dev mode is enough
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
